# project-3 â€“ Mean and Maximum Finder

This is a Python script that prompts the user to enter three numbers and then:

- Calculates the mean (average)
- Determines the greatest number among the three, including handling equal values

It is the first project where I practiced writing and using custom functions in Python.


# How It Works

- The user is prompted to input three integers.
- The script defines and calls two functions:
  - `getMean(a, b, c)`: Calculates and prints the mean of the three numbers.
  - `isGreater(a, b, c)`: Determines and prints which number is the greatest, or handles equality cases.
- Conditional statements are used to compare the numbers and handle different scenarios.


# What I Learned

- Defining and calling functions in Python
- Passing parameters to functions
- Writing conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Handling equality checks and edge cases
- Organizing code for better readability and reuse

This project marks my transition from writing linear scripts to using functions to structure my code more effectively.
